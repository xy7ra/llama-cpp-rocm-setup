## Why This License?

**This repo exists to help people, not make money.**

Too much AI knowledge is locked behind paywalls, sold in courses, or hoarded by companies.

If this helped you, the payment is simple:
- Help someone else
- Share what you learned
- Make the world a little better

**Knowledge should be free. Help should be free. This is free.**

If you want to say thanks - contribute back. Write a guide. Answer a question. Help a stranger.

That's worth more than money.
